untar the gzipped file punto-X.XX.tar.gz in a temporary file with the
command:

$ tar zxvf punto-X.XX.tar.gz

A tree structure directory has been created. Change to the punto
directory and simply type make punto, an executable file punto is
copied into the bin directory. Copy this file in /usr/bin or
/usr/local/bin or into a directory included in your PATH.

If you download the executable file copy it in /usr/bin or
/usr/local/bin or into a directory included in your PATH.
